## Hello! I'm Elizabeth.

I'm a scientist passionate about bioinformatics, reproducibility, and open science. I love working with data and the thrill of unlocking new biological insights. I especially love developing high-throughput workflows for handling large amounts of data and that just effortlessly *work*. 

I pride myself on creating user-friendly, reproducible, and open source tools. I've highlighted a couple repositories of tools and workflows I've created throughout my career for not only making my work more reproducible and enjoyable, but other researchers' as well. 

Feel free to open an issue in any of my repositories, or send me an email!
